   Creating an optimized production build ...
[@sentry/nextjs] The Sentry SDK has enabled source map generation for your Next.js app. If you don't want to serve Source Maps to your users, either set the `sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` option to true, or manually delete the source maps after the build. In future Sentry SDK versions `sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` will default to `true`. If you do not want to generate and upload sourcemaps, set the `sourcemaps.disable` option in `withSentryConfig()`.
